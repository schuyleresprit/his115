This year's project is tentatively called "House and Yaad: Representations and Realities of Caribbean Living." This is a project that asks us to investigate, historicize and visualize the relationship between the physical spaces that Caribbean people occupy and the social, cultural and political contexts that influence and emerge from these spaces.

Details to come...
