This year's project is tentatively called "Space and Place: Representations and Realities of Caribbean Living." This is a project that asks us to investigate, historicize and visualize the relationship between the physical spaces that Caribbean people occupy and the social, cultural and political contexts that influence and emerge from these spaces.

For this project, we will explore ideas and questions that connect the landscapes of Caribbean geography to the ways that Caribbean people live. Our research questions will include:
1) What is the historical significance of land and sea in the Caribbean imaginary?

Points of Entry:

Where do we begin?
