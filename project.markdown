The 2023-2024 project is tentatively called "Space and Place: Representations and Realities of Caribbean Living." This is a project that asks us to investigate, historicize and visualize the relationship between the physical spaces that Caribbean people occupy and the social, cultural and political contexts that influence and emerge from these spaces.  

For this project, we will explore ideas and questions that connect the landscapes of Caribbean geography to the ways that Caribbean people live. Our research questions will include:  

1) What is the historical significance of land and sea in the Caribbean imaginary? 
2) How does place/space affect the nature and quality of people’s lives in the Caribbean? 
3) How and why have institutions and systems shifted our relationships to these physical and imagined locations over time? 
* Landscapes of cities 
* ‘Natural’ disasters  
* Colonial violence 
* Modernity and Development

4) How have the relationships with place and space influenced art production in the Caribbean, from representation to aesthetics? 
* Historical fiction and imaginative literature 
* Visual and performing arts
* Film 
* Architecture and Design

5) In what ways have migration and displacement changed the configuration of communities - their physical capacity, their livability and their cultures?
