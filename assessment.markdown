__DH Project Reviews__

You will complete two (2) separate reviews of digital humanities project from an available list. Each piece should be 500-700 words. Select from the digital humanities projects listed below and prepare an evaluation of the content, research, tools and methods of that project. Consider the following questions and ensure that they are answered in your review:

1. What is the project about? What is the major research question as you understand it?
2. How did the researchers go about answering this question?
3. What does the DH site look like? Describe the interface, including the aesthetics, accessibility of information, various pages included.
4. What digital humanities tools are used to complete this project? Reference our readings on “What do digital humanists do?” and “How do they make that?”. You can also look at the lecture Powerpoint to review relevant terms and tools.
5. What do you think could be added/removed from this project to make it more effective in presenting the research?

Each review is worth 50 points.

You may select from one of the following projects:
* [Aftermaths: Community Responses to Climate Disaster](https://climatesofinequality.org/story/aftermaths-community-responses-to-climate-disaster/)

_Group Work and Participation_

Digital Humanities is a collaborative field of study. Much of the work we do this semester will require us working as a large collective or in smaller team. You will be responsible for and accountable to the larger community of learners by completing your tasks on time, providing encouragement and support to others and seeking assistance where necessary. Your ability to consistently work in a team situation will be assessed as part of this course. This will also include a project contribution statement, which will be submitted as part of the final project.


__FINAL PROJECT__

All course participants will work on the same project for the duration of the semester. You will be assigned clear roles and tasks for contribution to this larger project. All parts of your contribution must be submitted and uploaded to the appropriate platforms by the stated deadline. Your project grade will be based on content posted by that time. Any changes made to your submission after this date without the prior permission of the instructor will result in a grade of F on the project as it is a form of academic dishonesty.

__Project Proposal__

You are required to write a 500-word proposal of an individual digital humanities project that you will submit as part of the larger Caribbean Resistance project. Your proposal should include a brief explanation of why you chose the particular theme of resistance and what you hope to learn. Your proposal should also include your understanding of the broad connections between the novel(s) you chose and your selected theme of resistance. What are the key takeaways about this theme in the selected work and what do you think the author is attempting to say or accomplish about Caribbean life by highlighting this theme?  

The proposal should end with a description of the DH tools and methods you are considering employing to visualize the results of your research. You should select at least one but no more than three tools to use for this project. You should indicate what type (or combination) of project you will be doing based on options readings by Paige Morgan and Miriam Posner (see course schedule for links). Some examples of digital tools are:  

- Wax or Omeka digital archive or collection of specific content
- Digital Edition of an unpublished or out of print work
- Twine Storytelling or interactive game or experience on selected books/authors/genres/themes
- ArcGIS Storymaps or other experience on selected books and/or authors
- Knightlab JS Timeline and/or StoryMaps on specific books etc.
- Omeka Neatline storytelling with maps and timelines 


__Annotated Bibliography__
As part of your research process, you should consult secondary sources (i.e. resources about the primary texts and people represented in the spreadsheet) that provide insight and context on the topic you selected. You should complete an annotated bibliography of 5 sources. For each source, you write a 3-5 sentence paragraph summarizing the resource, explaining its relevance to your topic, and how you may incorporate some of the information you’ve learned in that resource. Please include archival, primary and secondary sources from a wide range of platforms and publications. You can include YouTube content (use your discretion for appropriateness and research worthy), articles from newspapers like The New York Times and The Guardian, academic journal articles and books found on Google Books and Google Scholar, interviews, websites, etc. You must provide all relevant bibliographic data (in APA format) for each listing as you would in a research paper references page. Please also provide the link to the resource or to its citation to allow us to create the Zotero entry at a later time.

__Final Project Presentations__

You will present the final project as a group to an audience in a hybrid format at the RTC Internship Symposium. You will prepare a 15-minute description of your work on this individual project, which includes challenges, successes and outcomes.
