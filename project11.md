## 2024 Project Summary and Prompt  

***Traditions of Caribbean Resistance*** 

The project for this cohort will focus on the history of resistance in the Caribbean region dating back to the Columbian arrival into contemporary moments. The project will take the approach from records of resistance as well as representations in literature and music, particularly. This digital project will place representations and analyses of Caribbean people’s responses to conquest, oppression, theft and violence in direct conversation with the archive - what we find in the primary source texts of our pasts - archives, civil records, registers and letters.  

The goal is to bring truths of the past together with truths of the imagination to consider an important question: what have we learned from the region’s engagement with resistance that can help us envision a stronger Caribbean future. This project specifically considers the Anglophone Caribbean with a view to contextualizing the stories of the Lesser Antilles in particular. 

The collaborative project will be a compilation of key resistance movements in the region from the perspective of the categories outlined below: 

* Indigenous resistance   
* Slave resistance   
* Maroon Resistance  
* Indenture Resistance   
* Labour resistance  
* Disenfranchisement Resistance  
* Women’s resistance   
* Political Resistance  
* Dread Resistance  
* Border Resistance  
* Queer Resistance  
* Climate Resistance  
* Technological Resistance    

***Individual Projects***  

Each student will be required to study one work of fiction (prose) from the recommended texts (approval will be required for a text not on this list) below and a major historical event(s) of resistance related to the themes of and draw parallels between the two in a digital project that provides analysis as well as opportunities for further investigation by users of the projects.
